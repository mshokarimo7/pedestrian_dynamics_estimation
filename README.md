Based on Roboflows "Supervision" repository, containing Computer Vision tools for Object Detection, Tracking and Counting: https://github.com/roboflow/supervision

BYTETrack has been one of the many software and tools implemented in this repository (Supervision repository).
Below is the link to the original BYTETrack repository, which is also licensed under the MIT license.

This repository, hence, uses a BYTETrack implementation from the Supervision repository. Only the Object Detection and Tracking has been used from Supervision. Rest of the code is not taken from anywhere. I gratefully thank the creators of Supervision and BYTETrack for providing the software.
